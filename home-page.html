            <h2>Ciri</h2>
            <p>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1253,[3] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[4] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.</p>
            <p>After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.</p>
            <h3>Cintra's Princess</h3>
            <p>Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year[5] and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt,[6] wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.</p>
            <p>Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, thought it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against Calanthe's wishes, who wished for them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the Sedna Abyss, making Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old. Angry at her nephew-in-law, Crach an Craite, for letting them sail out, Calanthe then had Crach swear a blood oath that he'd always protect Ciri before deciding to forbid Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months before Calanthe let Ciri visit Skellige once more every summer and winter.</p>
            <p>With the death of her mother, Ciri was now the only remaining heir to Cintra and thus Calanthe took special care to raise her granddaughter. Despite Calanthe's attempts to keep Ciri shielded from learning about being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to be a witcher since birth, Ciri's nanny told the young girl all about a white-haired witcher, and that he'd one day come for her to be taken away to be trained as one as well. When Calanthe found out she was furious but by then the seeds had been sown and Ciri began to firmly believe that was her destiny.</p>
            <p>Then, 6 years almost to the day when Duny's curse was lifted, Geralt returned to Cintra but Calanthe, not wishing to lose her only remaining descendant, hid Ciri amongst a group of boys and had them playing around in the moat outside the castle when Geralt dropped in, who erroneously believed Pavetta had a son and wondered which one "he" was in the group. Despite this, he refused to take any child with him and left without even learning the true identity of Pavetta's child.</p>
            <h3>Entering Brokilon</h3>
            <p>Shortly after, Calanthe arranged an engagement between Ciri and Windhalm of Attre, a now 20 year old who once vied for Pavetta's hand 7 years prior. However, Calanthe had a change in heart and called off the engagement years later[5] before setting up another one, this time to Kistrin, the sole prince of Verden. However, the now 10 year old Ciri wasn't fond of this idea or of Kistrin and, no sooner had she arrived in Verden in 1263 to meet her suitor and his family, did she escape with aid from some of the soldiers. This plan went awry though as the party got lost and ended up in the dreaded Brokilon region, a forest off-limits to anyone not friends with the dryads that lived there. While normally the dryads shot to kill on sight, Ciri wasn't noticed by them, though the rest of her party wasn't so lucky and were killed as they mistakenly crossed the border.</p>
            <p>While she wandered alone deeper into the dangerous forest, she was spotted by a giant centipede and almost met her death there when her screams were heard by Geralt and Braenn as they were incidentally nearby. After they killed the giant centipede though, Ciri tried to take off but immediately stopped when Braenn nearly hit her with an arrow. Despite this, the young princess refused to answer them and went as far as stating she'd have both of them beheaded before eventually joining them in their trek to Duén Canell, all the while telling Geralt how she didn't want a husband and threatening to bite Geralt to get him to answer her questions before the witcher threatened to whip her with his belt, making her behave politely the rest of the trip.</p>
